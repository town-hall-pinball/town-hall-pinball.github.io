Town Hall Pinball is working on a customized pinball machine. The overall plan is to:

* Use an existing pinball machine, likely "No Fear"
* Completely rebrand it with a new play-field, backglass, and cabinet artwork
* Design a new theme
* Design a new ruleset
* Design and/or use new animations, sound effects, and music
* Design new software

Since the theme and the name of the game has not yet been decided, we are using the working title of "no-fear" for now.

We are very early in the process and it will probably be some time until real progress is made. In the mean time, feel free to follow along and see development in action.
